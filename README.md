Dotfiles
========

Set of useful dotfiles (not just) for fresh *nix installs.


What dotfiles does it contain?
------------------------------

* zsh config


What does install.sh do?
------------------------

* sets up directories for development (`Code`, `Sites`)
* installs useful development packages (`php`, `python`, `apache`...)
* sets up `zsh` as default shell with some basic configs (oh-my-zsh)
* sets up dotfiles contained in this repository


Installation
------------

* Download install script: `wget https://raw.github.com/ondrowan/dotfiles/master/install.sh`
* Run it: `sh install.sh`
* Remove it: `rm install.sh`
* Log out (for shell changes to reflect)
* Log in and enjoy!


What systems are supported?
---------------------------

For now it's been tested on fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10 only.
